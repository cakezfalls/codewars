# 🧠 Codewars 60-Day Algorithm Challenge

Welcome to my **60-day Codewars challenge**!  
Every day (except one rest day per week), I solve at least one algorithmic coding problem to improve my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and build daily consistency.

Problems are organized by **difficulty level** (kyu), following the Codewars ranking system.

---

## 📅 Challenge Info

- **Duration:** 60 days  
- **Frequency:** 1+ problem per day  
- **Rest days:** 1 day off per week  
- **Languages:** TypeScript (primarily), Solidity, JavaScript  
- **Platform:** [Codewars]

Commits are labeled with `Day X`, where `X` is the current day of the challenge.

## 📁 Structure

Each top-level folder represents a **kyu level** (e.g. `8kyu`, `7kyu`, `6kyu`, etc.).  
Inside each folder, files are named after the **problem titles**

---

## ✅ Goals

- Build and maintain a consistent problem-solving habit
- Sharpen algorithmic thinking
- Improve fluency in TypeScript and functional approaches
- Explore a wide range of kyu levels over time
